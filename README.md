# Digital Archive 

## About 
This is a personal project that contains information about myself and answers the question: "what's good?". This is a multi-page site that serves as a time capsule for what I think looks, sounds, and tastes good to me at this stage of my life. 

## Objective

* Flex-Box containers/ items
* CSS Grids
* Navigation Design
* CSS Transitions 
* Interactive HTML/ CSS Design

On the landing page of the site, you will find a short essay about myself including my academic achievements, personal hobbies, and my personality type.

## Sounds Page 
On the Sounds page, I've included the music that sounds good to me. The page is separated into 3 sections: albums, playlists, and youtube. On the albums section, I've included 6 of my favorite albums at the time as well as my top 3 songs from each album. In the playlist section, I've linked 2 of my personal playlists that I have made that sound good to me, as well as 9 of my favorite songs from each playlist. Upon hovering over each album cover or playlist cover, an overlay will appear that will link the user to the playlist or album on Spotify upon clicking the "play button". In the YouTube Section, I've embedded 2 of my favorite YouTube tracks that I like listening to. Clicking the title will also link the user to the YouTube video directly.
