                    <p>
                        Hello world! If you're reading this, you've somehow landed on my digital archive, where I talk about the things I find good in life - from the looks, to the sounds, to the tastes.

                        If you don't know me, my name is Derek Moy (he/ him). I am currently 22 years old and based in Los Angeles, California. I've spent the past 3 years studying computer science at the University of San Francisco and received my Bachelor's degree in May 2020 (yay!). I am currently learning the basics of front-end development, and this is actually my first front-end project (!) so thank you for being a part of my journey!

                    <p>
                        About myself - I consider myself to be mostly extroverted. I love meeting new people and am usually the life of the party in social gatherings. My astrological sign is Leo and I have a Myers-Briggs personality type of ENFJ. If you're interested in any of those, it should tell you a lot about myself! If not, it basically means I have main character syndrome and love attention.

                    <p>
                        One of my hobbies outside of academia is thrifting. I like to express myself a lot through my style of clothing and appearance, so I love finding clothing items that you can't find everywhere! When I'm trying to be more active, I love choreographing and teaching dance. I've been dancing hip-hop since junior year of high school and continued with the dance team at my university. When I'm feeling more lazy, I like lounging on the couch while enjoying a good movie. My favorite genres are  psychological thrillers, mind-bending dramas, and international films. In the future, I'm hoping that I'd get more opportunities to travel and maybe even live abroad. I love learning and absorbing different cultures and believe that the world is way too big to be living in the same city (or state) your whole life!

    <!--                About What's Good-->
                    <p>
                        While all these activities are things that make me feel good, 2020 has been a rough year that has also made me appreciate the finer things in life (as cheesy as that sounds). So what else is good? Finding a new artist on Spotify. Driving with the windows down during golden hour. Giving a stranger a compliment. Treating yourself to a Starbucks peppermint mocha. Putting on a face mask at the end of the day. Sending your friend a funny tik tok. While these are all seemingly mundane activities, I find that they are always accompanied by a fleeting moment of "goodness" or happiness. And those moments, no matter how small, should always be celebrated. This digital archive is a collection of of those small feelings of good - through sight, hearing, and taste. I hope someday you'd be able to find joy in these things the way I have thus far! :')
